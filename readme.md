# Pandoras Aquarium

#### By Chris Martinez

## Description
_Ripples Come. And Ripples Go. Ripple Back to me....
This high art concept explores the temporal fragility of human expression.
This project uses the Web Audio API and HTML canvas to turn voice into ripples on the canvas. Be sure and either mute your sound or use headphones to avoid high screeching feedback. Try whispering. Try shouting. Try changing pitch. Try chanting tori's name.

## Known Bugs
_none

## The Future and Beyond....
_This project rather arbitrarily uses the 160th (of 1024) index of FFT frequency bins, after some trial-and-error with my own voice, speaking loudly and whispering and searching for the frequency range who's strength gives the best variance between a soft and loud voice.
i am also exploring ways to make the drops more responsive to beats and various instrumentation. for a great explanation of how the frequency data works https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44502536/determining-frequencies-in-js-audiocontext-analysernode .
